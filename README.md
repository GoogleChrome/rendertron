# Rendertron [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleChrome/rendertron.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleChrome/rendertron) [![NPM rendertron package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/rendertron.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/rendertron)

> Rendertron is a dockerized, headless Chrome rendering solution designed to render & serialise web pages on the fly.

Rendertron is designed to enable your Progressive Web App (PWA) to serve the correct
content to any bot that doesn't render or execute JavaScript. Rendertron runs as a
standalone HTTP server. Rendertron renders requested pages using Headless Chrome,
[auto-detecting](#auto-detecting-loading-function) when your PWA has completed loading
and serializes the response back to the original request. To use Rendertron, your application
configures [middleware](#middleware) to determine whether to proxy a request to Rendertron.
Rendertron is compatible with all client side technologies, including [web components](#web-components).

**Demo endpoint**

A demo Rendertron service is available at https://render-tron.appspot.com/. It is not designed
to be used as a production endpoint. You can use it, but there are no uptime guarantees.

## Middleware
Once you have the service up and running, you'll need to implement the differential serving
layer. This checks the user agent to determine whether prerendering is required.

This is a list of middleware available to use with the Rendertron service:
 * [Express.js middleware](/middleware)
 * [Firebase functions](https://github.com/justinribeiro/pwa-firebase-functions-botrender) (Community maintained)
 * [ASP.net core middleware](https://github.com/galamai/AspNetCore.Rendertron) (Community maintained)

Rendertron is also compatible with [prerender.io middleware](https://prerender.io/documentation/install-middleware).
Note: the user agent lists differ there.

## API

### Render
```
GET /render/<url>
```

The `render` endpoint will render your page and serialize your page.

### Screenshot
```
GET /screenshot/<url>
POST /screenshot/<url>
```

The `screenshot` endpoint can be used to verify that your page is rendering
correctly. Options are available as a JSON string in the `POST` body (options for `GET` are unsupported). See
[Puppeteer documentation](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.6.0/docs/api.md#pagescreenshotoptions)
for available options. You cannot specify the `type` (defaults to `jpeg`) and `encoding` (defaults to `binary`) parameters.

## FAQ

### Query parameters
When setting query parameters as part of your URL, ensure they are encoded correctly. In JS,
this would be `encodeURIComponent(myURLWithParams)`. For example to specify `page=home`:
```
https://render-tron.appspot.com/render/http://my.domain/%3Fpage%3Dhome
```

### Auto detecting loading function
The service detects when a page has loaded by looking at the page load event, ensuring there
are no outstanding network requests and that the page has had ample time to render.

### Rendering budget timeout
There is a hard limit of 10 seconds for rendering. Ensure you don't hit this budget by ensuring
your application is rendered well before the budget expires.

### Web components
Headless Chrome supports web components but shadow DOM is difficult to serialize effectively.
As such, [shady DOM](https://github.com/webcomponents/shadydom) (a lightweight shim for Shadow DOM)
is required for web components.

If you are using web components v0 (deprecated), you will need to enable Shady DOM to
render correctly. In Polymer 1.x, which uses web components v0, Shady DOM is enabled by default.
If you are using Shadow DOM, override this by setting the query parameter `dom=shady` when
directing requests to the Rendertron service.

If you are using web components v1 and either `webcomponents-lite.js` or `webcomponents-loader.js`,
set the query parameter `wc-inject-shadydom=true` when directing requests to the Rendertron
service. This renderer service will force the necessary polyfills to be loaded and enabled.

### Status codes
Status codes from the initial requested URL are preserved. If this is a 200, or 304, you can
set the HTTP status returned by the rendering service by adding a meta tag.
```html
<meta name="render:status_code" content="404" />
```

## Running locally
To install Rendertron and run it locally, first install Rendertron:
```bash
npm install -g rendertron
```

With Chrome installed on your machine run the Rendertron CLI:
```bash
rendertron
```

## Installing & deploying

### Dependencies
This project requires Node 7+ and Docker ([installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)). For deployment this
project uses the [Google Cloud Platform SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).

### Building from source
Clone and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron.git
cd rendertron
npm install
```

### Running locally
With a local instance of Chrome installed, you can start the server locally:
```bash
npm run start
```

### Using the Docker image
After installing docker, build and run the docker image
```bash
docker build -t rendertron . --no-cache=true
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --name rendertron-container rendertron
```

Load the homepage in any browser:
```bash
http://localhost:8080/
```

Stop the container:
```bash
docker kill rendertron-container
```

Clear containers:
```bash
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
```

#### Connection error (ECONNREFUSED)
In the case where your kernel lacks user namespace support or are receiving a `ECONNREFUSED` error when trying to access the service in the container (as noted in issues [2](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron/issues/2) and [3](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron/issues/3)), the two recommended methods below should solve this:
1. [Recommended] - Use [Jessie Frazelle' seccomp profile](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles/blob/master/etc/docker/seccomp/chrome.json) and `-security-opt` flag
2. Utilize the `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN` flag

[Recommended] Start a container with the built image using Jessie Frazelle' seccomp profile for Chrome:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrazelle/dotfiles/master/etc/docker/seccomp/chrome.json -O ~/chrome.json
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --security-opt seccomp=$HOME/chrome.json --name rendertron-container rendertron
```

Start a container with the built image using SYS_ADMIN:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --name rendertron-container rendertron
```

To check if your kernel is compatible with Docker, follow [Docker's instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/#troubleshooting). For CentOS 7, which doesn't have user namespaces enabled, you will [need to enable them](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron/issues/96#issuecomment-328305721).

#### Chrome crashes due to low shared memory
By default the size of /dev/shm in Docker is 64mb, which may result in Chrome crashes.
To increase the size of /dev/shm you can specify the size to Docker when running the image.
```
docker run ... --shm-size=256m
```

In the future, it will be possible to using /tmp instead of /dev/shm. See the
[Chromium bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=736452) for more detail.

### Deploying to Google Cloud Platform
```
gcloud app deploy app.yaml --project <your-project-id>
```

### Config
When deploying the service, set configuration variables by including a `config.json` in the
root. Available configuration options:
 * `analyticsTrackingId` default `""` - set to a Google Analytics property
 [tracking id](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en#trackingID) to
 send Rendertron rendering events to analytics.
 * `cache` default `false` - set to `true` to enable caching on Google Cloud using datastore
 * `debug` default `false` - set to `true` to log requested renders & pipe console messages
 from within the rendered pages.
 * `renderOnly` - restrict the endpoint to only service requests for certain domains. Specified
 as an array of strings. eg. `['http://render.only.this.domain']`. This is a strict prefix
 match, so ensure you specify the exact protocols that will be used (eg. http, https).
